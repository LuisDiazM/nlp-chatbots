## Tokenization

Is the process that converts sentences into words encoded by numbers

Is the process that completes the sequences of tokens with the same lenght of the matrix, by example, the incomplete sentences are filled by zeros.

## Embedings

## LSTM

## Transfer Learning
Is a technique that helps to train a model based on another pre-trained model This reduces the cost time, and amount of data because is not necessary to have a lot of data to train the new model.

## Featurizer
Is a part of NLP that converts input data to a features

## Steaming
Is the process of reduce a word to its steam, by example:
* branched  ---> branch
* branching ---> branch
* branches  ---> branch 

## Intents
Represents that the user try to say, and group by categories similar to a classification problem, by example:

**intent:greet**
